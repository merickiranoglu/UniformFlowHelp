# Solve for Discharge

$$\color{red}Q\color{black} = {{1} \over n} {A} {R^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{S}}$$ $$A = f(B, d), R = f(B, d)$$

where $$\color{red}Q\color{black}$$ is discharge, n is Manning's roughness coef., $$A$$ is flow area, $$R$$ is hydraulic radius, $$S$$ is channel slope, $$B$$ is channel width, $$d$$ is flow depth.
