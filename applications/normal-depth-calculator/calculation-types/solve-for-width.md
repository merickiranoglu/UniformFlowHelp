# Solve for Width

$$Q = {{1} \over n} {A} {R^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{S}}$$ $$A = f(\color{red}B\color{black}, d), R = f(\color{red}B\color{black}, d)$$

where $$Q$$ is discharge, n is Manning's roughness coef., $$A$$ is flow area, $$R$$ is hydraulic radius, $$S$$ is channel slope, $$\color{red}B\color{black}$$ is channel width, $$d$$ is flow depth.
