# Solve for Slope

$$Q = {{1} \over n} {A} {R^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{\color{red}S\color{black}}}$$ $$A = f(B, d), R = f(B, d)$$

where $$Q$$ is discharge, n is Manning's roughness coef., $$A$$ is flow area, $$R$$ is hydraulic radius, $$\color{red}S\color{black}$$ is channel slope, $$B$$ is channel width, $$d$$ is flow depth.
