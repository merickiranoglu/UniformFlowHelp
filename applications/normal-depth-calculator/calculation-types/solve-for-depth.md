# Solve for Flow Depth

$$Q = {{1} \over n} {A} {R^{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{S}}$$ $$A = f(B, \color{red}d\color{black}), R = f(B, \color{red}d\color{black})$$

where $$Q$$ is discharge, $$n$$ is Manning's roughness coef.,
$$A$$ is flow area, $$R$$ is hydraulic radius,
$$S$$ is channel slope,
$$B$$ is channel width,
$$\color{red}d\color{black}$$ is flow depth.
