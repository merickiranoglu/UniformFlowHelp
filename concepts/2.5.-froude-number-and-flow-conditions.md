# 2.5. Froude Number and Flow Conditions

Froude number provides a way of classifying flow conditions based on the relationship between flow velocity and flow depth. It helps assess the energy state of water flow. It is defined as the ratio of gravitational forces to inertial forces:

$$
F = {gravitational forces\over inertial forces} =  {V \over \sqrt{gd}}
$$

where,

* F is Froude Number,
* V is average velocity,
* g is gravitational acceleration
* d is flow depth.

Subcritical flow is deep, slow flow with a low energy state and has a Froude number less than one $$(F < 1)$$. Critical flow occurs when the Froude number equals one $$(F = 1)$$; there is a perfect balance between the gravitational and inertial forces. Supercritical flow is shallow, fast flow with a high energy state and has a Froude number greater than one $$(F > 1)$$.
