# 2.6. Standard Step Method

_**Standard step method**_ is a computational technique utilized to estimate one-dimensional surface water profiles in open channels with gradually varied flow under steady state conditions. It uses a combination of the energy, momentum, and continuity equations to determine water depth with a given a friction slope, channel slope, channel geometry, and also a given discharge.
